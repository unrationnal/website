You have probably heard of the recent custom GPTS just made available to the public by openai, building one has been reduced to a very easy process thanks to intelligence of ChatGPT and the technology of openai let's jump right in.

## What is even a custom GPT

ChatGPT is a basically super intelligent chat bot that you can interact with through openai services. It has demonstrated outstanding capabilities and has taken a big place in lots of people daily lives thanks to the advantages and great capabilities it has. Now in order to make chatGPT perform beyond the capabilities of a simple chatbot, openai has made available a serie of tools that allow ChatGPT to do a little more. In fact it is now able to analyze picture to look for details, with the Dalle model, it is now also able to generate images, with its personnal code generator it is able to do some data processing and access different API accross the internet.

With these tools made available to the public, different custom GPTS with very specific capabilities have been emerging, we can for example note the "Sous-Chef" GPT which is able to help you choose a healthy recipe through a picture of your fridge. We can also look at the data analyst GPT which can analyze large quantity of data and give you a detailled report. New GPTS are being created everyday simplifying people lifes using chatGPT capabilities. You can learn more about them by reading our dedicated article [Everything to know about OpenAI's Custom GPTS](/blogs/en/how-to-create-your-own-openai-custom-gpt) but let's look at how to be among the builders of this new waves.

## What do you need to build a custom GPT
Building a gpt will require only three (3) things from you, here there are.

- [an openai account subscribed to chatgpt plus.](#openai-account)
- [a great custom gpt idea.](#a-good-gpt-idea) 
- [(optional) a domain or a verified account if you intent to share your gpt](#a-domain-or-a-verified-account)

## Openai account
In order to be able to create a customGPT you will need a ChatGPT plus account which is required to interact with the model GPT4 which is the model user for the custom GPTS. In order to have that type of account, you will need to purchase a subscription on openai website which should be about 20$.
That will give you access to ChatGPT4 the most recent model, you will also have access to Dalle which can generate images and the library of all the custom GPTS that you can use but also participate in. Now that your account is set up, let's move to your ideas.

## A good GPT idea
Once you have an openai account with all the accessibility, before thinking about creating a new custom GPT for a specific task, I would suggest looking up if what you were thinking about hasn't already been done. Indeeed if your problem is a common one, it is most likely that someone has already built a robust GPT taking care of it, so you won't have to go through the process of creating a new one from the ground up. Besides, gpts that are highly ranked have most likely yielded satisfying results, unless you achieve that same level of success you should not have to bother with the process. On the other hand, if there is no custom GPT what so ever taking care of your problem, it is sign for a need of your custom GPT, you should then just simply evaluate the requirements of your idea before getting to build it.

## A domain or a verified account
You should be aware that there are different options to share your GPT, you could decide to keep it only to your account so that it's functionnalies are private to you, or you could decide to share it with the vast ecosystem of the GPT store. If you had chosen the later, you would need a domain name on the web or a verified openai account in order for your GPT to be associated with something.

If you have an openai account with a subscription to the GPT plus, chances are your account is already verified, particulary if you had made the transaction directly from the openai website, you should be able to find your GPT builder profile in your openai account and just activate it. In the situation that you didn't purchase your openai subscription directly through the website, you maybe went through the apple store or play store, you would then need to provide openai with any credit card in order to activate your GPT builder profile.

If you possess a domain on the internet and want to associate it to your custom GPTS to drive traffic, you could instead use that for your GPT builder profile. Just head to your GPT builder setting and select the option "domain name". Openai will provide you with a certain text that you would need to insert into your domain name DNS setting from your domain provider website. After you have done the process, come back to your GPT builder profile and click "check domain". Depending on your domain provider, the check would maybe be validated only after 48hours, but in most case, it should be done instantly. Once you have passed the check your GPT builder profile will be activated and you will be able to see your website name directly next to your custom GPTS.


## Building the custom GPT

Now that your profile and requirements are all set up it's time to build the custom GPT itself. This part of the process should be easy and fun as long as you have a clear idea on what type of things your GPT should be accomplishing. Make sure you thoroughly think through all the micro details and edge cases then open a chat with chatGPT. Click on your profile account at the bottom and then on "my GPTS". You should now see an option saying create GPT click on it to start the building process.

Building a GPT as been simplified to a simple interaction with ChatGPT itself as you may notice looking at the tempplate. You can choose to opt out and go to configure section, but it would be better to start with ChatGPT itself, and then finetune the result with the configure section.

So now start explaining your idea to ChatGPT while giving the most details as possible, it would quickly generate a logo and name for the GPT so you won't have to worry about that part. Simply discuss the process while giving specific details and covering edge cases, ChatGPT itself would be asking you question, but it is safe to cover those sections yourself so that you don't forget. Once everything has been set up, now head to the configure section and look at the instructions section. This is basically the guide to ChatGPT on how to act accordingly to your custom GPT. Make sure to change the details that need refinement and if you have a lot more instructions or you have data that you would need ChatGPT to refer it, there is a PDF section where you can upload pdf files containing those informations.

Ensure that everything is in order, and then start interacting directly with your custom GPT in the window on your right to ensure that everything is working properly. This part of the process may need several back and fourth depending on the complexity of your custom GPT so make sure that the GPT performs at a satisfying level otherwise it wouldn't be very useful.

Once you have a satisfying level of performance with your GPT, time to upload it. Click on the save icon on the top right of your screen and now choose among the different options if you want it to be private or shared with everyone. Once your choice locked-in, if you have been successfully completed the part about your openai GPT builder account, you should be able to confirm the upload and have your GPT uploaded to the gpt store.

Congratulation, you just uploaded your first GPT, it may become of a great help in people lifes and maybe if might figure at the top of the GPT store featuring list but in order to rise your chances of that happening, you will need to share about your gpt.

## After building
Once your GPT built and uploaded to the GPT store, you may choose to simply let it be and let some people stumble upon it and enjoy it's functionnality. Another solution might be to actively share about your GPT on your social media. There already a lot of different communities where people share about their GPTS on reddit or twitter, you can take advantage of that to give more visibility to your GPT and accelerate its ascension to the top. 

## conclusion
Building your GPT must have been a pretty interesting process, being able to create something so complicated in these simple steps should be a testimony on how technology has evolved in our society. You can definitely give yourself a pat on the back as you might have built something that might be extremely useful to a lot of people. The good thing is now that you understand and know the process, you may be able to create more GPTS and extending the solutions you provide to people. There is also an opportunity of making money through your GPT with it's popularity ir ut's functionnality.
